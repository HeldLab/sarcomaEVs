## Data and code associated with the manuscript "An atlas of plasma extracellular vesicle proteins distinguishing cancer and doxorubicin sensitivity"

This reposotory includes the code and key summary tables related to the manuscript by Van Tine _et al._ focused on sarcoma extracellular vesicles. Several of the steps are best performed on a computer cluster to ensure sufficient memory.

All proteomic data for the Sarcoma cohort is deposited in UCSDâ€™s [Massive](massive.ucsd.edu) with ID MSV000092188. Reviewers can use the username MSV000092188_reviewer and password VanTine_001_0616 to anonymously access the data. The FTP download link is ftp://MSV000092188@massive.ucsd.edu. Accessing data for the Hoshino _et al._ dataset is detailed in their [Cell manuscript](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420308746?via%3Dihub).
